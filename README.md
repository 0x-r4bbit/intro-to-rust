# Intro to Rust

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is [Pascal Precht](https://pascalprecht.github.io) and this is the
workshop content from my _Intro to Rust_ course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

> The structure of this document is highly inspired by [Kent C. Dodds'](https://kentcdodds.com)
  awesome [Learn React Hooks Instructions](https://github.com/kentcdodds/learn-react-hooks)

## Pre-Workshop Instructions

In order for us to maximize our efforts during the workshop, please do the following:

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below) (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be
      using (~5 minutes)

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.15.1 or greater

For the following tools, please head over to [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions:

- `rustc`
- `rustup`
- `cargo`

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

## Setup the project

Once all tools are installed on your machine, setting up the project for this workshop
is as simple as cloning this repository using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PascalPrecht/intro-to-rust
```

Since we'll be starting entirely from scratch in this workshop, there aren't any further
steps required to set up this project.

## Working with this repository

First and foremost, all exercises for this workshop can be found in dedicated README files
inside the `./exercises` folder. From here, you can work your way through.

Once you've finished an exercise, you can take a look at the [solutions](https://github.com/PascalPrecht/intro-to-rust-code-samples/commits/solutions) branch.
Every commit includes information about the changes necessary for each lesson, 
as well as steps to run the examples.

**Important:** To keep the chronological order of changes throughout the course,
commits of this repository may be rebased at any time if adjustments or updates are needed.

Enjoy!
