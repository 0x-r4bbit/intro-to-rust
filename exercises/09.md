# Introducing loops

## Background

So far our `sum` program has been doing one thing - it asks the user for two numbers,
it adds them up and it shows the result. Then, it stops. The program is done.

If users want to add two numbers again, they have to restart the program. Wouldn't it be
nice if it just kept asking users for input and outputting the results?

It turns out this can be done quite easily using Rust's built-in `loop` feature.

`loop` is really just what it says: a loop. It keeps running the code inside of it until
it either exits or the user stops the program (e.g. using `CTRL+C`).

```rust
loop {
  println!("This runs infinitely");
}
```

A call to `std::process::exit()` as discussed in the previous lesson, will stop the loop
as well.

## Exercise

Wrap our `sum` program inside a `loop` so it keeps asking and adding numbers.
