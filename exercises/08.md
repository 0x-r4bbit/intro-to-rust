# Exit the program

## Background

When a user enters values in our `sum` program that are not valid numbers, it's probably better to
stop the program instead of relying the pre-defined default value `0`.

Exiting a program can be done using `std::process::exit()` which is a function that stops the
current process with an exit code. For that we import the `process` module:

```rust
use std::process;
```

And then call `process::exit()` with an exit code. Any exit code that is not `0` will be 
interpreted as exit with error.

## Exercise

Update our `sum` program to exit with error code `1` whenever the user enters and invalid number.
