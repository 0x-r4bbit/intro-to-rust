# Your first "Hello World" program

## Background

Alright, first things first. We'll be using different tools throughout this workshop to make
certain tasks easier, but it's still good to have an idea what's going on behind the scenes.
Therefore, in this first exercise we'll be creating our first Rust program from scratch.

Every Rust program has a `main` function that will be called when we execute the program. 

```rust
fn main() {
  // your code goes here
}
```

To display values on the screen, we can use Rust's built-in `println` macro.
Don't worry for now what macros are. The only thing to keep in mind is that the syntax of
calling a macro requires us to put a "!" in front of the function parenthesis:

```rust
println!("Some text");
```

Another thing to notice is that the text passed to this macro has to be surrounded
with double-quotes (`""`). This is due to how Rust interprets data inside
double-quotes vs single-quotes as different types.

## Exercise

Write a program that outputs "Hello World!" using the `println` macro. To do that, 
create a folder `src/hello-world` and a `main.rs` file inside of it.

Once the program is written, we can compile it using the `rustc` program:

```
$ cd src/hello-world
$ rustc main.rs
```

This will create an executable that can be run from the command line:

```
$ ./main
```
