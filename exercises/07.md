# Error Handling using Pattern Matching

## Background

One of Rust's powerful language features is something called "Pattern Matching". Pattern Matching
enables us to evaluate any valid expression and, based on the resulting value, execute a pre-defined
code path.

Pattern Matching is usually done in cases where an expression can result in mulitple possible values,
like `Result<T, E>` for example. A `Result` either resolves into `Ok(val: T)` or `Err(error: E)` but
we can't know until the program is actually executed.

To ensure we cover all possible (error) cases, types like `Result` have to be properly handled.
We pattern match values using the `match` keyword:

```rust
// We possibly reassign a value to `a` further down
// so we have to make it mutable here
let mut a: u32 = 0;

// .parse() returns a `Result` so it either emits
// `Ok(value)` or `Err(error)`
match first().trim().parse() {
  Ok(value) => a = value,
  Err(_err) => println!("Not a number!");
};
```

There's many many more things that can be done with pattern matching, but let's get there one step at
a time!

## Exercise

Change our `sum` program to use pattern matching instead of `expect()` calls to implement better
error handling.
